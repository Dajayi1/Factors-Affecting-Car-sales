# Background
The auto industry sometimes experiences very rough patches in terms of sales which could be attributed to inflation. This makes individuals rethink expensive purchases. Additionally, supply-chain snags are making it difficult to even find new cars which further causes a plummet in auto sales. Therefore, this dataset was analyzed for companies to determine which factors could boost their market sales.


### Key Factors Considered in Car Sales:
 
*Affordability 
*Resale Value
